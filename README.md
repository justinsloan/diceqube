# Diceqube
The world's most secure password generator.

## What makes these passwords perfect and safe?

Every one is generated from a "`qube`" of quantum fluctuations in the [cosmic microwave background radiation][cmbr] without any discernable pattern. The maximum entropy [quantum random number generator][qbrng] we use guarantees that every `qube` is individually unique and will never be produced again. Ever.

Therefore, these password strings are just for you. No one else can ever see them or get them. Each set displayed are totally, uniquely yours â€” forever.

The "Application Notes" section below discusses various aspects of using these random passwords for locking down wireless WEP and WPA networks, for use as VPN shared secrets, as well as for other purposes.

The "Techie Details" section at the end describes exactly how these super-strong maximum-entropy passwords are generated (to satisfy the uber-geek inside you).

## FAQ

### What is a `qube`?
A `qube` is a block of 1024 random numbers derived from a snapshot of a single random point in 3-dimensional spacetime. The `qube` is used as the input-vector to generate cryptographically-strong passwords.
